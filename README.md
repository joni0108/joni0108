- 👋 Hi, I’m Jonathan, but everyone calls me trollpro0108. I am a forex trader and programmer.
- 👀 I’m interested in C#, MQL4, MQL5, & Python languages
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AI implementation in the financial markets and building a windows application with useful features for traders and other entrepeneurs.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on MQL4/MQL5 projects (where most of my experience comes from), but open to C# and Python.
- My current open source project is the MQL-SDK, a free SDK for Metatrader 4 & 5 expert advisors with some useful libraries and more enhacements comming soon!
